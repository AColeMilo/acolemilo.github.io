				<h2>About</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center; margin-right: 440px;">
                            1. I have achieved the highest rank in the Boy Scouts of America program, Eagle.
                        <br>I had done a multitude of things on my way in earning the rank, to include
                        <br>hiking 23 miles in a day, sailing islands just south of florida, backpacking
                        <br>dozens of miles in the mountains New Mexico, reaching heights of 12, 13, and 14
                        <br>feet. I have been camping multiple weeks on end, ziplining, swimming, fire-making,
                        <br>skiing, and many, many other things. In order to earn the rank of eagle,
                        <br>I had to design a multi-day project that involved me finding a business to 
                        <br>do the project, gather donations, materials, volunteers, coordinating said 
                        <br>volunteers, finding a weekend to schedule the project, lead and oversee the
                        <br>project, and make sure no one was hurt. The only one who got hurt however, 
                        <br>was me as I now have a burn scar on my right bicep after I set down a
                        <br>gas-powered tamper down too fast and the engine burned my arm.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        2. I have very recently just got a job as a zipline instructor. I've done ziplining before,
                        <br>completing numerous zipline and rope courses, but it had admittedly been a couple years.
                        <br>I had to relearn how the ziplining process worked; belaying, climbing, 
                        <br>attching myself to the line, riding the line, detaching myself, and detaching
                        <br>other people from the line. I was the first to test the integrity of the line by simply 
                        <br>riding the line since the pandemic.
                        <br>
                        3. I have 5 pets, 3 dogs and 2 cats. My dogs are Lucy, who is a nearly 10 year old mastiff, 
                        <br>Ronin, who is a 2 and a half year old german shepherd, and our newest dog, Decker, who 
                        <br>is just under a year. Lucy is more couch than dog, Ronin is more cat than dog, and
                        <br>Decker is more moron than dog. Our cats are Jack, who is 8 years old, and Cali (or calypso)
                        <br>who is about 3. Jack is the stereotypical orange cat, i.e. dumb, stupid, talkative, 
                        <br>clingy, etc., etc., and Cali is, in very loving terms, a nutcase through and through.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        4. I have an older brother, who is also an Eagle Scout and one of the few people I look
                        <br>up to, a mother and father who I love very much, and my loving girlfriend who I've 
                        <br>been with for 5 and a half years and counting.
